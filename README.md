# Eventify

Eventify is a web application designed to simplify event discovery based on a user's interests. It uses a recommendation algorithm based on collaborative filtering. The most suitable events are suggested based on user preferences and reviews, as well as those of other users who share the same interests. Additionally, a group of users can receive joint suggestions that take into account their preferences and suggest the events that will appeal to all of them the most. The app gives users the ability to create, rate, and write comments on events. Moreover, they can synchronise their email calendars with the dates and times of their chosen events.
